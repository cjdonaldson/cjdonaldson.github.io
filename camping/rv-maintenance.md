### Electrolyte level
- distilled water only
- do not overfill
- check monthly
- clean terminals with baking soda and water
- specific gravity @ 80F
    - do not read if recently watered or charged
    - let rest x hours
    - adjust +/-0.004 per +/-10F difference
    - 1.274 = 100% charge (green band)
    - 1.239 = 75% charge (white band)
    - 1.201 = 50% charge (red band)
    - 1.300+ = overcharged, check charging system
    - 1.200- = replace battery (red band)
- load tester
    - measure voltage
        - 12.6V = 100%
        - 12.4V = 75%
        - 12.2V = 50%
        - 12.0V = 25%
        - <11.9V = replace battery
    - load for 10 seconds and re-measure voltage
        - 10.5V+ = good
        - 10.4V- = replace battery
    - test after resting
        - remove tester and let rest for 10 minutes
        - retest
    - enable charging system and re-measure after 30 seconds
        - do not load test while charging
- discharge test
    - fully charge battery
    - turn off all loads
    - measure voltage
    - apply 1/2 load for ??? 15 seconds
    - measure voltage
    - apply full load for ??? 15 seconds
    - measure voltage
    - enable charging system and re-measure ??? after 30 seconds
